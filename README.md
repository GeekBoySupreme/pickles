# Pickle
Pickle is a platform to make silly scrapbook pages online - [Demo](https://picklepixel.netlify.app/)<br/>
Here is a [video walkthrough](https://www.loom.com/share/0d2ab19261ab4c4aa85e847f4fa4bc68).

### Motivation
With design tools becoming increasingly versatile and far-reaching, we have forgotten the art of making silly scrapbooks online.
Pickle sets out to be the spiritual successor to the Neopets and Geocities of yore.

### How it works
- Open [the site](https://picklepixel.netlify.app/)
- Click on "Create a Pickle" to open the editor
- Make a new Pickle
- Download to your machine, or publish it to the Pickle gallery.

### How I used Supabase
Supabase powers the entire gallery feature of Pickle. The editor is not yet supremely powered and needs a lot of work. But whatever silly, small thing you make, you can publish it to the Pickle gallery to inspire others. Pickle currently does not have an auth - you just add your name and Instagram handle to a form while publishing your pickle.
The platform uses a couple of simple get( ) and insert( ) requests.
