# Pickle
Pickle is a platform to make silly scrapbook pages online.

### Motivation
With design tools becoming increasingly versatile and far-reaching, we have forgotten the srt of making silly scrapbooks online.
Pickle sets out to be the spiritual successor to the Neopets and Geocities of yore.

### How it works
- Open [the site](https://picklepixel.netlify.app/)
- Click on "Create a Pickle" to open the editor
- Make a new Pickle
- Download to your machine, or publish it to the Pickle gallery.
